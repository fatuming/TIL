# Job Information

semi project part1.

> This project is just part of my practice, so something went wrong and looks like amateur, it's alright! I am sure I am getting better and better and that is my goal :)

* We were looking for something fun to use and quite informative things.
* The reason why we choose this subject is that we are currently taking a class in python for getting a job in the future, so we would like to give some information about that to our classmates.



## DATA

We got the data from 2 typical recruits webpage of Korea, Saramin and Jobkorea. We used web crawling with 2 different ways that we learned, `BeautifulSoup` and `Selenium` with certain keywords that we choose.

-  www.saramin.co.kr
-  https://www.jobkorea.co.kr/



## What for

We got the assignment to improve our web crawling skill so we focused on using all the crawling skills.  Also actually this is my first time to handle data with `pandas` , so I guess that is the meaning of this assignment and we use `geojson` to visualize all the data.



## Result

We won the first prize in our semi project contest :). Our project looks a bit rough, but we tried our best to use all the skills that we learned as a review.
