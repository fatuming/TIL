# Job Information

semi project part1.

> This project is just part of my practice, so something went wrong and looks like amateur, it's alright! I am sure I am getting better and better and that is my goal :)

* We were looking for something fun to use and quite informative things.

- The reason why we choose this subject is that we are currently taking a class of python for getting a job in the future, so we would like to give some information of that to our classmates.



## DATA

We got the data from 2 typical recurits webpage of Korea, Saramin and Jobkorea. Basically we used web crawling with 2 different ways that we learned, `BeautifulSoup` and `Selenium` with certain keywords that we choose.

-  www.saramin.co.kr
-  https://www.jobkorea.co.kr/



## What for

We got the assignment to improve our web crawling skill so we focused on using all the crawling skills.  Also actually this is my first time to handle data with `pandas` , so I guess that is the meaning of this assignment and we use geo json to visualize all the data.



## Result

We won the first prize from our semi project contest :). Our project looks a bit rough, but we tried our best to use all the skill that we learned as review.
